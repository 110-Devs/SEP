- Cody Server on default port: [http://localhost:3311](http://localhost:3311)

## Contribution

This repository is a skeleton for a Cody Engine app that has batteries included. This means, that Cody will
generate source code directly into the cloned repository and that designers and developers can add custom designs and logic, too.

When you want to contribute changes to the skeleton itself, you have to make sure to not submit any generated or customized code.
Therefor, we've prepared a terminal command that will set up a contribution environment with:

- an example domain, so that the skeleton is filled with some functionality
- .gitignore files that hide them self and the example domain from being committed
- changes in some registry files

`npm run prepare-contribution`

Unfortunately, there is no way to tell git via .gitignore to keep an existing file unchanged and ignore local changes.
So you have to run the following commands to manually tell git to ignore changes in the registry files:

```shell
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/aggregates.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/commands.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/events.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/queries.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/types.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/types/definitions.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/shared/src/lib/types/references.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/be/src/command-handlers/index.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/be/src/query-resolvers/index.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/be/src/repositories/index.ts
git update-index --skip-worktree packages/fe/src/app/pages/index.ts
```

*Please Note: If you add a new registry file that should be included in the skeleton, please make sure that changes through contributions are not tracked. 
Ask a maintainer for help, if you're not sure how to do it!*
